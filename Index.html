        <h1>This is My Third Assignment</h1>

        <p>So far Chatgpt has been giving me assignments on web development.</p>
        <p>The assignments have been helpful.</p>
        <P>And I seem to be <span id="learning">learning</span> a lot.</span></P>

         <ul> <h2>This is What I Have Gained from the Assignments:</h2>
            <li>I have gotten more consistent</li>
            <li>I have learnt more than what my course has taught me.</li>
            <li>It is showing me what real life experience looks like.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a more fluent developer</li>
         </ul>
